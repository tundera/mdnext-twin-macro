## Usage

Coming with a base understanding of the [NextJS opinions and documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started), will give you a solid grasp on the structure of our templates.

## Breakdown

‚Äî **_jsconfig.js_**

NextJS lets us configure absolute paths for our app. We use this to easily import all of our functions and utilities inside of our `src` directory

‚Äî **_pages_**

The pages directory defines your routing. Lifecycle methods like `getStaticProps` / `getStaticPaths` / `getServerProps` are available at the page level. This is where we consume our MDX content as data to pass to our components.

`_app.js`:
NextJS allows you to override the App component, which is used to initialize pages. We have also wrapped our application with a custom `Layout` component in this file, to persist site-wide styling across pages. More [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app)

`_document.js`:
Allows you to augment our application's `<html>` and `<body>` tags.

`all-data/index.js`:
This page is an example of displaying links to all of your individual MDX data pages. Here we use `getStaticProps` to feed the frontmatter of our `MDX` files for our components.

`data/[slug].js`:
Here we utilize NextJS dynamic routing. By using `getStaticPaths` we're able to feed a dynamic slug, handling all of the logic once and applying it to each `MDX` data that we load. This allows us to then match to our data in `getStaticProps` and display that to the page and our components.

`index.js`:
Our page at the root of our app, lives inside of the `pages` directories `index.js`.

‚Äî **_src_**
Our `src` directory holds all of our client code. Our `components`, custom `hooks`, `utility` functions, and our `MDX` files all live here, with the first three available for absolute path imports üëç

‚Äî **_next.config.js_**
For custom configuration around things like `environment variables`, `webpack`, `pageExtensions`, and many [more](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/next-server/server/config.ts#L12-L63), you can utilize `next.config.js`

‚Äî **_tailwind.config.js_**
For extending or overriding the default tailwind utility classes. `twin.macro` builds off of this file, so any custom styling you'd like to include will be picked up by `twin` and available for use with the `tw` prop. [Read more about Tailwind configuration options.](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#app)

## Resources

- The [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) is excellent. Definitely a great resource for learning how to effectively apply the tailwind utility classes. üíØ
- There's an excellent [Tailwind cheat sheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) as well, if you'd like more condensed documentation.
- Twin.macro's documentation for the most part lives in [their README](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro).
- They have a [twin.macro Discord community](https://discord.gg/Xj6x9z7) that is a good place to get support or advice.
- They also maintain [a twin.macro example project](https://codesandbox.io/embed/next-tailwind-emotion-starter-8h2b2?module=%2Fpages%2Findex.js) to demonstrate how the library works.
